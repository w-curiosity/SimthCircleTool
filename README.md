Smith Chart is a graphical calculator or nomogram designed for electrical and electronics engineers specializing in radio frequency (RF) engineering to assist in solving problems with transmission lines and matching circuits.

According to the relationship between impedance and reflection coefficient, the impedance circle diagram which contains a series of circles and arcs can be drawn on the reflection coefficient complex plane. These circles and arcs represent the magnitude of impedance, admittance, standing wave ratio, etc. Their values can be easily and intuitively readout within the unit circle of the reflection coefficients. It is an effective tool for selecting and calculating matching impedance in high frequency and microwave circuit design.
